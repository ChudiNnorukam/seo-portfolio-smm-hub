# Cursor Auto – Working Agreement

PRIORITIES (in order):
1) Don't regress Lighthouse, A11y, SEO. If a change risks this, propose an alternative.
2) Follow /RULES.md and /prompts/system.mdc at all times.
3) Make minimal diffs. Prefer unified patches over large rewrites.

ALLOWED FILES:
- /seo-portfolio/** for Astro site
- /03_cornerstones/** and /04_longtails/** content
- /silo_plan.csv, /site_outline.md, /link_map.csv
- /scripts/check-performance.sh, /perf-budget.json
- /prompts/** and /.cursor/**

AVOID:
- Introducing external font CDNs without font-display: swap.
- Removing JSON-LD, canonical, OG/Twitter tags.
- Adding heavy client JS without showing the CLS/INP impact.

PATCH POLICY:
- Show a PLAN (3 bullets) → DIFF (unified) → VERIFY (commands + pages to click + what to inspect).
- Keep each change < 200 lines unless explicitly asked.

FAIL SAFE:
- If a patch touches files outside the allowed list, abort and ask for confirmation.
