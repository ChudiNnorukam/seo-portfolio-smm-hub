1. **Day 1 – Set Your Goals**
   
   Define clear SEO goals: traffic targets, lead targets and the three mid‑ to long‑tail keywords you’ll focus on. Note your baseline metrics (current traffic, bounce rate, number of leads).

2. **Day 2 – Build Your Platform**
   
   Set up your project repository and deploy a basic Astro + Tailwind site. Ensure you’re using our scaffold with sitemap generation, JSON‑LD schema and performance budgets.

3. **Day 3 – Install Analytics**
   
   Add analytics (Google Analytics 4, Plausible or another privacy‑friendly alternative). Create a baseline report of current pageviews, sources and user engagement.

4. **Day 4 – Submit Your Sitemap**
   
   Generate and submit your XML sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Verify that your pages are being indexed.

5. **Day 5 – Outline Your Cornerstone Article**
   
   Create an outline for your main cornerstone article (the definitive guide you want to rank for). Use bullet points for each section.

6. **Day 6 – Write 500 Words**
   
   Draft the first 500 words of your cornerstone article. Focus on the intro and the first section. Gather three supporting references or data points.

7. **Day 7 – Outline Two Long‑Tail Posts**
   
   Sketch outlines for two long‑tail blog posts related to your main keywords. List out at least three H2/H3 headings for each.

8. **Day 8 – Publish Your First Long‑Tail Post**
   
   Write and publish your first long‑tail post. Include at least two internal links (one to the cornerstone draft and one to another relevant page).

9. **Day 9 – Improve Performance**
   
   Run Lighthouse on your site and fix any performance issues. Ensure images have width/height attributes, lazy‑load non‑critical assets and respect your perf budget.

10. **Day 10 – Add 500 Words More**
   
   Add another 500 words to your cornerstone article. Include a data visualization or image with alt text.

11. **Day 11 – Publish Your Second Long‑Tail Post**
   
   Write, optimize and publish the second long‑tail post. Use an engaging title and meta description with your target keyword.

12. **Day 12 – Collect Questions for Your FAQ**
   
   Write down common questions from potential clients or from People Also Ask boxes. These will become your FAQ section. Draft two–three short answers.

13. **Day 13 – Launch Your Social Profiles**
   
   Create or optimize your LinkedIn, X/Twitter and Reddit profiles. Share your first blog posts with a short summary and link back to your site.

14. **Day 14 – Publish the Cornerstone**
   
   Finish and publish your cornerstone article. Add Table of Contents, internal links and a strong call‑to‑action to your product or contact page.

15. **Day 15 – Draft an Outreach Email Template**
   
   Write a one‑paragraph outreach template to pitch guest posts or collaborations. Keep it concise and focus on the value you deliver.

16. **Day 16 – Resubmit Your Sitemap**
   
   Update your sitemap and submit it again. Check indexing status and fix any crawl errors.

17. **Day 17 – Create an AI Tool**
   
   Build a simple AI tool (e.g. review response generator) and write documentation. This tool becomes a unique asset to attract backlinks.

18. **Day 18 – Post About Your Tool**
   
   Write a blog post explaining how to use your tool. Include a code snippet, use‑cases and a call‑to‑action to download the tool.

19. **Day 19 – Begin Outreach**
   
   Send your outreach email to five prospects. Track replies in a spreadsheet. Aim for quality, not quantity.

20. **Day 20 – Review Your Analytics**
   
   Analyze your analytics reports. Identify which posts bring the most traffic and adjust your content plan accordingly.

21. **Day 21 – Create Social Templates**
   
   Draft variations of headlines and summaries for LinkedIn and X/Twitter. Save them for future post promotion.

22. **Day 22 – Write Another Long‑Tail Post**
   
   Research a low‑competition keyword and write a third long‑tail post. Link back to your cornerstone and previous posts.

23. **Day 23 – Audit Your Internal Links**
   
   Review all your published content and ensure every page has at least two–four internal links. Update as needed.

24. **Day 24 – Create a Lead Magnet**
   
   Design a small lead magnet (checklist, cheat sheet or email course). Add an email signup form to collect addresses.

25. **Day 25 – Draft Your Welcome Sequence**
   
   Write a short welcome email and a follow‑up message for new subscribers. Provide value and mention your product.

   Improve your cornerstone article with new data or case studies. Add internal links to your tool and lead magnet.

27. **Day 27 – Technical SEO Audit**
   
   Run a site audit (e.g. using SE Ranking or similar). Fix broken links, add alt text and improve accessibility.

28. **Day 28 – Share Again on Social**
   
   Repurpose your posts and share them again on social platforms. Try different captions and hashtags.

29. **Day 29 – Plan a Backlink Campaign**
   
   Identify ten websites or influencers who might link to your content. Draft personalized outreach messages.

30. **Day 30 – Reflect and Plan Ahead**
   
   Review your progress. Note what worked and what didn’t. Set goals for the next 60 days and decide which strategies to double down on.
