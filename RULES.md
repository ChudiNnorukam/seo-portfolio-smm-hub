# Project Rules

- Don't regress metrics in perf-budget.json.
- Keep canonical, OG/Twitter, JSON-LD on all relevant pages.
- Prefer semantic HTML and aria-* over JS for behaviour.
- Every content change: update "Further reading" and validate internal links.
- Commit messages: chore|feat|fix(scope): summary
